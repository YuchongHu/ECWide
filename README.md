# Exploiting Combined Locality for Wide-Stripe Erasure Coding in Distributed Storage

The repository includes the source code of ECWide and the paper accepted by FAST 2021. 

We implement two ECWide prototypes, namely ECWide-C and ECWide-H, to realize combined locality. The former is designed for cold storage, while the latter builds on a Memcached-based in-memory key-value store for hot storage.
